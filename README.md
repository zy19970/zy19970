### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Materials and Manufacturing, Beijing University of Technology. I am extremely fortunate to be advised Prof. Jianfeng Li. Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, North China University of Technology.
- ðŸ”¬ I am broadly interested in Medical Robotics, Control Theory, and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ”Ž These days, I am mostly drawn by the development of Diffusion Models. A topic that I am actively thinking about/working on is How to build effective physical human-robot interaction strategies through multimodal information.
