### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŽ“ **About me**: I am a PhD student at the College of Mechanical & Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jianfeng Li. Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, North China University of Technology.

- ðŸ”¬ **Research**: I am broadly interested in Medical Robotics, Control Theory, and Machine Learning.


- ðŸ”Ž **Focus on**: These days, I am mostly drawn by the development of Diffusion Models. A topic that I am actively thinking about/working on is How to build effective physical human-robot interaction strategies through multimodal information.
